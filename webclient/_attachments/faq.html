        <p>
        The flinkt <i>"magic pen"</i> lets you highlight statements on a web page quickly, then do lots of things with them easily.
        One of the handiest things you can do is get a URL which contains the highlighted line and email it around or post it.
        </p>
        <p> 
        More importantly, <a href="http://www.flinkt.org/demo">flinkt</a> remembers the line, the page, and the context for you, so you can later get back to things you read.
        The flinkt site gives you your own private database, for keeping your thoughts organized ...without making you do a lot of work to organize them.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Q: How is this different than fleck, diigo, clipmarks? <br>
            A: Several reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>No one wants to fill out a form.  It disrupts flow, and just sucks.</li>
                <li>Tags put too much responsibility on the user.  They are a nit-wit solution to organization.  Remember search engine meta tags?  They're only worth remembering for the lesson.</li>
                <li>Too many steps required to start using the tool. Making accounts sucks.  Inventing passwords sucks.</li>
                <li>Too many steps required to do something with the content.</li>
                <li>To send your selections to others they need to either visit the tool's site, or you need another channel fb/twitter, etc.  These require configuration and limit reach.</li>
                <li>All of them require mental investment before receiving value.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Q: What about security and privacy?<br>
            A: All user-specific information on flinkt is completely private, though you can use flinkt to send to public/social places.
               <br>
               Sites which have content sent around through flinkt get summary information on what is sent and how often, but not who.
        </li>
        <li>
            Q: I'm a web site maintainer, why would I want to put this on my site instead of the standard facebook, digg, etc. buttons?<br>
            A: You get to know the exact things on the page readers took interest in.  Because we protect reader anonymity, they can confidently share more from your site.
